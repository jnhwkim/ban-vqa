# Bilinear Attention Networks

⚠️ **Regrettably, I cannot perform maintenance due to the loss of the materials. I'm archiving this repository for reference**

This repository is the implementation of [Bilinear Attention Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07932) for the visual question answering and Flickr30k Entities tasks. 

For the visual question answering task, our single model achieved **70.35** and an ensemble of 15 models achieved **71.84** (Test-standard, VQA 2.0).
For the Flickr30k Entities task, our single model achieved **69.88 / 84.39 / 86.40** for Recall@1, 5, and 10, respectively (slightly better than the original paper).
For the detail, please refer to our [technical report](http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07932).

This repository is based on and inspired by @hengyuan-hu's [work](https://github.com/hengyuan-hu/bottom-up-attention-vqa). We sincerely thank for their sharing of the codes.

### Updates

* Bilinear attention networks using `torch.einsum`, backward-compatible. ([12 Mar 2019](https://github.com/jnhwkim/ban-vqa/issues/15#issuecomment-471864594))
* Now compatible with PyTorch v1.0.1. ([12 Mar 2019](https://github.com/jnhwkim/ban-vqa/pull/22))

### Prerequisites

You may need a machine with 4 GPUs, 64GB memory, and PyTorch v1.0.1 for Python 3.

1. Install [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) with CUDA and Python 3.6.
2. Install [h5py](http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/build.html).

*WARNING: do not use PyTorch v1.0.0 due to [a bug](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/15602) which induces underperformance.*

## VQA
### Preprocessing

Our implementation uses the pretrained features from [bottom-up-attention](https://github.com/peteanderson80/bottom-up-attention), the adaptive 10-100 features per image. In addition to this, the GloVe vectors. For the simplicity, the below script helps you to avoid a hassle.

All data should be downloaded to a `data/` directory in the root directory of this repository.

The easiest way to download the data is to run the provided script `tools/download.sh` from the repository root. If the script does not work, it should be easy to examine the script and modify the steps outlined in it according to your needs. Then run `tools/process.sh` from the repository root to process the data to the correct format.

For now, you should manually download for the below options (used in our best single model).

We use a part of Visual Genome dataset for data augmentation. The [image meta data](https://visualgenome.org/static/data/dataset/image_data.json.zip) and the [question answers](https://visualgenome.org/static/data/dataset/question_answers.json.zip) of Version 1.2 are needed to be placed in `data/`.

We use MS COCO captions to extract semantically connected words for the extended word embeddings along with the questions of VQA 2.0 and Visual Genome. You can download in [here](http://images.cocodataset.org/annotations/annotations_trainval2017.zip). Since the contribution of these captions is minor, you can skip the processing of MS COCO captions by removing `cap` elements in the `target` option in this [line](https://github.com/jnhwkim/ban-vqa/blob/master/dataset.py#L393).

Counting module ([Zhang et al., 2018](https://openreview.net/forum?id=B12Js_yRb)) is integrated in this repository as `counting.py` for your convenience. The source repository can be found in @Cyanogenoid's [vqa-counting](https://github.com/Cyanogenoid/vqa-counting).

### Training

```
$ python3 main.py --use_both True --use_vg True
```
to start training (the options for the train/val splits and Visual Genome to train, respectively). The training and validation scores will be printed every epoch, and the best model will be saved under the directory "saved_models". The default hyperparameters should give you the best result of single model, which is around **70.04** for test-dev split. 

### Validation

If you trained a model with the training split using
```
$ python3 main.py
```
then you can run `evaluate.py` with appropriate options to evaluate its score for the validation split.

### Pretrained model

We provide the pretrained model reported as the best single model in the paper (70.04 for test-dev, 70.35 for test-standard).

Please download the [link](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1OGYxF5WY4uYc_6UobDjhrJIHkl2UGNct) and move to `saved_models/ban/model_epoch12.pth` (you may encounter a redirection page to confirm). The training log is found in [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1sEa5bTMOFv_Xjo_A0xeNw379_Sljg9R_).

```
$ python3 test.py --label mytest
```

The result json file will be found in the directory `results/`.

### Without Visual Genome augmentation

Without the Visual Genome augmentation, we get **69.50** (average of 8 models with the standard deviation of **0.096**) for the test-dev split. We use the 8-glimpse model, the learning rate is starting with **0.001** (please see this change for the better results), 13 epochs, and the batch size of 256.

## Flickr30k Entities
### Preprocessing
You have to manually download [Annotation and Sentence](https://github.com/BryanPlummer/flickr30k_entities/blob/master/annotations.zip) files to `data/flickr30k/Flickr30kEntities.tar.gz`. Then run the provided script `tools/download_flickr.sh` and `tools/process_flickr.sh` from the root of this repository, similarly to the case of VQA. Note that the image features of Flickr30k were generated using [bottom-up-attention pretrained model](https://github.com/peteanderson80/bottom-up-attention.git).

### Training

```
$ python3 main.py --task flickr --out saved_models/flickr
```
to start training. `--gamma` option does not applied. The default hyperparameters should give you approximately **69.6** for Recall@1 for the test split.


### Validation
Please download the [link](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1xiVVRPsbabipyHes25iE0uj2YkdKWv3K) and move to `saved_models/flickr/model_epoch5.pth` (you may encounter a redirection page to confirm).

```
$ python3 evaluate.py --task flickr --input saved_models/flickr --epoch 5
```
to evaluate the scores for the test split.
